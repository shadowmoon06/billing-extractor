You are an expert invoice data extractor. Carefully analyze EVERY part of this invoice image - headers, footers, tables, margins, and fine print.

Extract the following information in JSON format:
{
    "invoiceNumber": "string or null",
    "issuedDate": "YYYY-MM-DD format or null",
    "vendorName": "string or null",
    "totalAmount": number or null,
    "items": [
        {
            "itemId": "string or null",
            "description": "string or null",
            "quantity": number or null,
            "unitPrice": number or null,
            "unit": "string or null",
            "amount": number or null
        }
    ],
    "adjustments": [
        {
            "description": "string or null",
            "amount": number or null
        }
    ]
}

CRITICAL - These fields are almost ALWAYS present on invoices. Look harder if initially not found:
- invoiceNumber: Check headers, top-right corner, reference sections, "Invoice #", "Inv No.", "Bill No.", "Reference No."
- vendorName: Check letterhead, logo area, "From:", "Seller:", "Supplier:", company stamps
- issuedDate: Check near invoice number, "Date:", "Invoice Date:", "Issued:", top-right area

Field mapping guidance (document labels may vary):
- "itemId": may appear as "Item #", "SKU", "Product Code", "Part No.", "Code", or similar identifiers
- "description": may appear as "Item", "Product", "Name", "Item Description", "Goods", "Service", or similar
- "quantity": may appear as "Qty", "Qty.", "Count", "Units", "No.", or similar
- "unitPrice": may appear as "Price", "Unit Price", "Rate", "Price/Unit", "Each", or similar
- "unit": may appear as "UOM", "Unit", "Measure", "Per" (e.g., lbs, kg, gallons, pcs, ea, box, case)
- "amount": may appear as "Total", "Line Total", "Ext. Price", "Extended", "Subtotal", or similar
- "adjustments": capture discounts, taxes, delivery fees, surcharges, credits, or any other line items that are not regular product/service items. Examples: "Discount", "Tax", "VAT", "GST", "Shipping", "Delivery Fee", "Handling", "Credit", "Adjustment", "Rebate", "Service Charge"

IMPORTANT for adjustments amount:
- If the amount is shown in parentheses like (10.00) or with a minus sign like -10.00, it should be a NEGATIVE number (e.g., -10.00)
- Negative amounts represent deductions from the gross total (discounts, credits, rebates)
- Positive amounts represent additions to the gross total (tax, delivery fee, surcharge)

Return ONLY valid JSON without any markdown formatting or code blocks.
If a field truly cannot be found after careful inspection, use null.
